Qlang (Quick Language) is a programming language created in 2025 as a final project by a student. The language is not competitive with other languages and was created solely as an example. How does it work? Qlang works as a command translator to C#, i.e. the program first \"translates\" the code into C# and only then into a binary file. When compiling into .exe (or other executable files), the language simply compiles the C# program with your program class. What can I use it for? For anything, you can even write your own C# libraries for the language, which means you can use it in the same way as C#. The language also has a built-in library for working with Raylib (via Raylib_cs ). Instructions for use can be found here . Should I use it? If it's for serious use, then no. The language isn't that advanced, and it's easier to just use C#. My first program The creation of the first program is described here .","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#qlang-documentation","text":"","title":"Qlang documentation"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Installation instructions can be found here .

Each project contains the following files: project_name/ main.ql project.settings.json compile.settings.json main.ql - a file that will be processed by the compiler. project.settings.json - project parameters (name, as an example). compile.settings.json - compilation parameters (using debug mode as an example).

Creating a copy Creating a new copy: const myClassInstance = MyClass . new (); Functions Definition The definition can be made in class or in a file. When declared in a class, the private modifier is also available. When added, the function can be called only in the parent class. To declare a function, use the keyword function , the function name, and the parameters in parentheses (if any): function main (): { // Function body. } function functionExample ( const < String > var ): { // Body recived var (must be `String` type). } class MyClass : { // Acess only from `MyClass` (`MyClass.classFunction()`) or in `MyClass` (just: `classFunction()` or with keyword `this`) function classFunction (): { } // Access only in `MyClass` private function privateClassFunction (): { } } Function call To call a function, write its name and parameters in parentheses (if any): function main (): { // Call function. functionExample ( \"Hello, World!\" ); } function functionExample ( const < String > var ): { // Body recived var (must be `String` type). } Variables Definition Declarations occur in classes, functions, blocks, and simply in a file.
